# Stand-Work-Experiments

This repository contains some of my successful experiments for Redlab-I testbench harware using Qt creator and Python.
This software is strongly intended for avionics test-bench hardware and cannot be run as a standalone app (excepting "Plugin Creator").

# System prerequisities

To compile all projects you will need to install the following libs right on your system:
- glfw3
- glew
- Tkinter GUI extension for Python language
- Qt Creator version 4.x or higher



Enjoy :-)
